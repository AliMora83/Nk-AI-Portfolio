# Walkthrough: Namka Mission Control V1.0.6

V1.0.6 introduces critical "Sequential Logic" to protect the system budget and ensure Forge agents act only under Kimi K2.5's strategic guidance.

## 🍱 UI & Grid Polish
- **Daily Burn Spacing**: Vertical padding has been reduced and height has been optimized to allow the **Active Agents** list to move up, creating a more dense and efficient information layout.
- **Task Backlog Compression**: The sidebar Task Backlog is now strictly constrained to 25% of the bento grid, providing more horizontal space for live telemetry and budget metrics.

## 🤖 Forge 'Logic Lock'
OpenClaw has been configured with a new safety protocol:
- **Idle State**: Any agents working on "The Forge" tasks will automatically switch to **"Idle (Awaiting Kimi)"** if no fresh strategy is detected in Firestore.
- **Kimi Channel**: Added logic to route strategic updates to a dedicated Discord channel (#kimi-intelligence) once the webhook is provided.

## 🛡️ Kill-Switch Automation
The Orange Protocol has been upgraded from passive to proactive:
- **Dynamic Activation**: When the Daily Burn reaching 80% ($8.00 / $10.00 limit), the system automatically triggers the **ORANGE ACTIVE** state.
- **Visual Feedback**: The Sidebar indicator pulses red, and the Dashboard button switches from "ACCESS PROTOCOL" to a high-visibility **"EXECUTE KILL-SWITCH"** button.
