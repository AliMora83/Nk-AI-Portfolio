# Walkthrough: Namka Mission Control V1.0.7

V1.0.7 focuses on immediate visual refinement and process automation, enhancing the Founder's experience and establishing a reliable audit trail.

## 🖼️ UI Polish & Bug Fixes
- **Full-Screen Blur (Refactored)**: Diagnosed and fixed a z-index stacking context issue where the 'Coming Soon' modal was nested within the sticky Sidebar, preventing it from covering the Header.
    - **Solution**: Implemented a global `UIContext` and moved the modal to the root layout level.
    - **Result**: The modal now applies a `backdrop-blur-md` filter to the **entire screen**, overlaying all UI elements including the sticky header and sidebar.
- **Daily Burn Optimization**: Padding within the 'Daily Burn' card has been tightened (`py-3 px-5`), eliminating dead space and further balancing the Bento grid layout.

## 🤖 Process Automation
- **Proof of Work Logging**: A new script `scripts/log_proof_of_work.js` now automates the archiving of `walkthrough.md` to `docs/logs/`, ensuring every directive is indexed for Gemini's future reference.
