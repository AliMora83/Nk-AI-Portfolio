# FOUNDRY STRATEGY BRIEF: V1 (2026)

## Market Opportunity: The Efficiency Arbitrage
Current intelligence indicates a massive arbitrage gap in the **Legal and Compliance** sectors. Tasks previously requiring a 1-week turnaround from human counsel (risk profiling, securities analysis, due diligence) are being completed by agentic systems in **15 minutes**. 

**Foundry Alpha**: Our competitive advantage lies not in "raw intelligence" but in **Workflow Codification**. We don't just provide an LLM; we provide the *Infrastructure* that enforces organizational consistency and model-agnostic resilience.

## High-Ticket Pricing Model: "The Triad"

| Tier | Name | Target | pricing | Core Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **Nexus** | Small/Mid Law Firms | $5k - $15k / mo | Modular "Plug & Play" agents for routine discovery/research. |
| **Tier 2** | **Sovereign** | Enterprise Legal/Finance | $25k+ / mo + Setup | Custom workflow codification + Human-in-the-loop (HITL) safety layer. |
| **Tier 3** | **Omni-Agent** | Strategic Partners | Performance Based | Full Agent-as-a-Service (AaaS). We take 10-20% of the *time-saved value*. |

## 3. High-ROI Technical "Alpha"
1. **Model Agnosticism**: Foundry will maintain high-switching-cost independence from single providers (Google/OpenAI). 
2. **HITL Orchestration**: Built-in escalation frameworks for high-stakes decision-making.
3. **Consistency Enforcement**: Moving away from "fresh judgment" to AI-backed organizational precedents.

## Next Steps
1. **Discord Sync**: Post this brief to `#foundry-strategy` for agent review.
2. **Nama Optimization**: Refine OC data ingestion to handle 2026-scale legal datasets.
